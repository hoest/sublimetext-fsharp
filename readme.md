F# syntax highlighting for Sublime Text.

Based on [ionide-fsgrammar][1], converted using [Sublime Syntax Convertor][2]\*.

Changes/Fixes are more then welcome!

Including a sublime-build; you need to add the path to 'fsi.exe' or 'fsharpi' in
your $PATH.

\* Excluding markdown comment rules though, since Sublime doesn't support the
`while` match extension that came with TextMate 2.
